# Text Markup
When creating a web page, you add tags (markup) to the contents of the page. These tags provide extra meaning and allow browsers to show users the appropriate structure for the page. 
In this folder, we focus on how to add markup to the text that appears on the webpages. We explore:
- <b>Structural Markup </b>: the elements we can use to describe both headings and paragraphs
- <b>Semantic Markup </b>: Elements which provides extra information, such as where emphasis is placed in a sentence, that something you have written is a quotation, meaning of acronyms, etc.

### Structural Markup
We will cover the following Structural markup elements:
- Heading markup elements : 'h1', 'h2', 'h3', 'h4', 'h5', 'h6'
- Paragraphs markup:	'p'
- Bold & Italics: 'b', 'i'
- Superscript & Subscript: 'sup', 'sub'
- Line Breaks & Horizontal rules: 'br', 'hr'

### Semantic Markup
Semantic markup elements are text elements that are not intended to affect the structure of the web page, but they do add extra information to the pages.
Semantic markup elements are used to describe the content of the web page more accurately.  Other programs such as screen readers or search engines, can use this extra information. Examples of semantic markup elements:
- 'strong' : Indicates that its contents has strong importance (displayed in bold)
-'em': Indicates emphasis that subtly changes the meaning of a sentence (displayed in italics)
- 'blockquote': Used for longer quotes that takes up an entire paragraph. (indented)
- 'q': used for shorter quotes that sit withing a paragraph. (quoted)
- 'abbr': Used for abbreviation or an acronyms. A title attribute on the opening tag is used to specify the full term.
-'cite': Used to indicate where a citation is obtained from. Should not be used for a person's name (italicised)
- 'df': Used to indicate the defining instance of a new term. (italicised)
- 'address': Used to contain contact details for the author of the page. It can contain physical address. (Italicised)
- 'ins' and 'del': 'ins' is used to show contnt that has been inserted into a document, while the 'del' element can show text that has been deleted from a document. (Contents of 'ins' are underlined, while contents of 'del' are striked-through)
- 's': used  to indicate something is no longer accurate or relevant, but should not be deleted. (Striked-through)
