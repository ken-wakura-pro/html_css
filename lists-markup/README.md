# Lists Markup
There are 3 types of HTML lists:
- ordered lists: Use numbers. Marked-up using 'ol'
- unordered lists: Use bullets. Marked-up using 'ul'
- definition lists: Used for defining terminologies. 'dl' is used to create the definition list. 'dt' is used to contain the term being defined. 'dd' is used to contain the definition.

Lists can be nested inside one another
