# Structure of Web Pages
In this folder, we conduct a number of exercises to understand how HTML describes the structure of web pages.
HTML uses elements to describe the structure of web pages. 'HTML tags' act like containers. They tell us something about the information that lies between their opening and closing tags. The term 'tag' and 'element' are often used interchangeably. Strictly speaking, however, an element comprises the opening tag, the closing tag and any content that lies between them.
'Attributes' provide additional information about the contents of an element. They appear on the opening tag of the element and are made up of two parts: a 'name' and a 'value', separated by an equal sign.
In this folder we looked at how to use the tags:
- 'body' : Everything inside the 'body' element is shown inside the main browser window.
- 'head' : 'head' element contains information about the page (rather than information that is shown within the main part of the browser window).
- 'title' : The contents of the 'title' element are either shown in the top of the browser, above where you usually type in the URL of the page you want to visit, or on the tab for that page (if your browser uses tabls to allow you to view multiple pages at the same time).
